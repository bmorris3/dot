Dot is a forward model for starspot rotational modulation in Python.
It is similar to `fleck <http://fleck.readthedocs.io>`_
(`Morris 2020 <https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.02103>`_),
but written for sampling with `PyMC3 <https://docs.pymc.io>`_. The source code
is `available on GitHub <https://github.com/bmorris3/dot>`_.
